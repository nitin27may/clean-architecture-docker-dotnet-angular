# Clean Architecture Full-Stack Starter: .NET, Angular, and MS SQL Server with Docker
## Project Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive boilerplate for building a full-stack web application using **.NET 9 Web API**, **Angular 19**, and **MS SQL Server** with Docker. It includes built-in features like user registration, authentication with JWT, CRUD operations, and is optimized for both development and production environments.

A startup project template built with **Angular 19** and **ASP.NET Core 9** (cross-platform), featuring a complete implementation of login, user management, and role-based access control. It also includes essential functionalities for rapid application development.

This template is designed for ease of use, customization, and scalability. It adheres to best practices and conventions of both Angular and ASP.NET Core, leveraging modern technologies and tools to ensure an efficient and streamlined workflow.

## Quick Start
To quickly start the application, clone the repository and run Docker Compose:

```
  git clone https://github.com/nitin27may/clean-architecture-docker-dotnet-angular.git angular-dotnet
  cd angular-dotnet 
  //rename .env.example to .env 
  docker-compose up
```

**Note** I have used SMTP send function, please update the account details

## Project Folders 
The apps written in the following JavaScript frameworks/libraries:

| folder          | Description                                                                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend (Angular)** | [Angular 18-based front-end application with JWT security.](https://github.com/nitin27may/clean-architecture-docker-dotnet-angular/tree/master/frontend)         |
| **Api (.Net)** | [.NET 8 REST API with Clean Architectuire.](https://github.com/nitin27may/clean-architecture-docker-dotnet-angular/tree/master/WebApi) |

### Built With
#### Angular (19.0.0)

The fronend of this project is developed in Angular. As we are using Server Side Rendering (SSR) we have used Nodejs alpine image in place of other lightweight docker image like nginx to run Angular app.

It contains sample for below (Both UI and API implmentation ):

 1. User Registration
 2. Login
 3. Forgot Password
 4. Change Password
 5. Role based API access 
 6. Profile
 7. A complete CRUD example for Contact

Also, it has sample code for Auth guard, services, http interceptors, resolver and JWT implementation


**[Dockerfile for Production](/frontend/Dockerfile)**
**[Dockerfile for Development](/frontend/debug.dockerfile)**

#### Dotnet (9.0.0)

Rest APis of this project is devloped using dotnet

It contains sample for:

1. Middleware implemetation for logs
2. JWT implementation for Authorization
3. API routing
4. User registration, login, forgot password, reset password
5. Role based api permission
6. Audit Log
7. Fulent Validation
8. Complete CRUD example for Contact


**[Dockerfile for production](/backend/src/Dockerfile)**
**[Dockerfile for development](/backend/src/Debug.Dockerfile)**


## Getting started

### Using Docker

#### Prerequisite
  
  Install latest [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)


#### Data Seed

 We have added a seed file with data, which will be loaded on docker compose, it has 3 users with different role:
 
 | Username             |  Passsword    |  Role    |
