# Clean Architecture Full-Stack Starter: .NET, Angular, and MS SQL Server
## Project Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive boilerplate for building a full-stack web application using .NET 9 Web API, Angular 19, and MS SQL Server with Docker. It includes built-in features like user registration, authentication with JWT, CRUD operations, and is optimized for both development and production environments.

## Architecture
The project is structured with Clean Architecture principles, separating the solution into distinct layers to ensure scalability, maintainability, and testability. This includes a modular design with API, Application, Domain, and Infrastructure layers.

## Quick Start
To quickly start the application, clone the repository and run Docker Compose:

```
  git clone https://github.com/nitin27may/clean-architecture-docker-dotnet-angular.git angular-dotnet
  cd angular-dotnet 
  //rename .env.example to .env 
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up
```

**Note** I have used SMTP send function, please update the account details

## Project Folders 
The apps written in the following JavaScript frameworks/libraries:

| folder          | Description                                                                                  |

| **Frontend (Angular)** | [Angular 18-based front-end application with JWT security.](https://github.com/nitin27may/clean-architecture-docker-dotnet-angular/tree/master/frontend)         |
| **Api (.Net)** | [.NET 8 REST API with Clean Architectuire.](https://github.com/nitin27may/clean-architecture-docker-dotnet-angular/tree/master/WebApi) |

### Built With
#### Angular (19.0.0)

The fronend of this project is developed in Angular. As we are using Server Side Rendering (SSR) we have used Nodejs alpine image in place of other lightweight docker image like nginx to run Angular app.

It contains sample for below (Both UI and API implmentation ):

 1. User Registration
 2. Login
 3. Forgot Password
 4. Change Password
 5. Role based API access 
 6. Profile
 7. A complete CRUD example for Contact

Also, it has sample code for Auth guard, services, http interceptors, resolver and JWT implementation


**[Dockerfile for Production](/frontend/Dockerfile)**
**[Dockerfile for Development](/frontend/debug.dockerfile)**

#### Dotnet (8.0.0)

Rest APis of this project is devloped using dotnet

It contains sample for:

1. Middleware implemetation for logs
2. JWT implementation for Authorization
3. API routing
4. User registration, login, forgot password, reset password
5. Role based api permission
6. Audit Log
7. Fulent Validation
8. Complete CRUD example for Contact


**[Dockerfile for production](/Api/Dockerfile)**
**[Dockerfile for development](/Api/debug.dockerfile)**


## Getting started

### Using Docker

#### Prerequisite
  
  Install latest [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)


#### Data Seed

 We have added a seed file with data, which will be loaded on docker compose, it has 3 users with different role:
 
 | Username             |  Passsword    |  Role    |
